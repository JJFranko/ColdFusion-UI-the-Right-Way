It is our belief (and this will be expanded in more detail in the Introduction) that these UI controls lead developers down a path that brings nothing but despair and destruction. Yes, we're being overly dramatic. But at the same time we've seen far too many people get screwed by using these controls instead of just learning to do it the right way.\r\n\r\nThis repo contains both text as well as samples you can run in your local environment. All samples will work without a datasource and should require no setup. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
